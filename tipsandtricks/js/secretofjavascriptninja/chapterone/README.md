> People often feel that if they know C# or Java, they already have a pretty solid
understanding of how JavaScript works. But it’s a trap! When compared to other
mainstream languages, JavaScript is much more functionally oriented.
##### Differences are:
* Functions are first-class objects
* Function closures
* Scopes
* Prototype-based object orientation

##### Transpilers give us access to tomorrow’s JavaScript today (transpilers (“transformation + compiling”)
* Traceur https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/wiki/
* Babel http://babeljs.io/docs/setup/.

##### Understanding the browser
* Document Object Model ( DOM )
* Events
* Browser API

##### Using current best practices
* Debugging skills
* Testing
* Performance analysis
